# React-Router-Ex

A simple React project that started as an implementation of the React Router tutorial found in [this](https://medium.com/@pshrmn/a-simple-react-router-v4-tutorial-7f23ff27adf) Medium article. 

After I finished the [Flux tutorial](https://github.com/facebook/flux) available on Facebook's GitHub account, I decided to update the project and add Flux and some functionality on it. 

Both of the aforementioned tutorials are excellent and I cannot recommend them enough to anyone starting out with React.

Î¤his project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
